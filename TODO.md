## Current Status
**Started**: June 16, 2025  
**Target Completion**: June 30, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Project Setup ✓ → Local LLM Integration

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality first
- Keep code modular for easy extension
- Prioritize performance and offline capability
- Maintain clean, minimal UI throughout

## Decision Log
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama (chosen for ease of use and reliability)
- **UI Framework**: React with Vite (for fast development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for rapid, consistent styling)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, embedded)
